# Mploy

MPloy is a mobile + web platform built for SCU's 2017 BroncoHack hackathon.

The premise is to build a platform that will allow job seekers that may be homeless or at a lack of resources to have a platfrom that will allow them easy access and communication with employers offering small odd-jobs or part-time employment that is directed towards these populations, to allow them to build their skills and potentially find more permanent employment.

The mobile app is built with Swift and hosted on a Google Firebase back end.
